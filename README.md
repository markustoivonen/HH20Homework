# HH20Homework
This is the homework assignment for HoxHunt Summer Hunters Data Science -track, done in March of 2020 by Markus Toivonen.

Original instructions can be found in the `instructions.pynb` file, and my solution is located at the `homework.ipynb` file. 

In this project I collect a dataset that contains URLs that are considered safe and malicious. A malicious website in this context is defined as website designated for phishing purposes.

From the URLs, I extract appropriate features that can be used determine their safetiness. These features of the data are then visualized and fed into a machine learning algorithm that tries to learn from a training data set to distinguish a safe URL from a malicious one.
