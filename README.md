# HoxHunt Data Scientist Summer Internship Homework
This is the homework assignment for HoxHunt Summer Hunters Data Science -track, done in March of 2020 by Markus Toivonen. HoxHunt is a computer and network security company from Finland. More info at www.hoxhunt.com.

Original instructions for the assignment can be found in the `instructions.pynb` file, and my solution is located at the `homework.ipynb` file. The data used can be found in the directory called `data`. If you want to run the actual code, then the files need to be in the same directory, unless you modify the IO commands.

In this project I collect a dataset that contains URLs that are considered safe and malicious. A malicious website in this context is defined as website designated for phishing purposes.

From the URLs, I extract appropriate features that can be used determine their safetiness. These features of the data are then visualized and fed into a machine learning algorithm that tries to learn from a training data set to distinguish a safe URL from a malicious one.
